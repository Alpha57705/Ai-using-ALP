Alright let me get this strait, MANY people have been able to create Artificial intellegence, but this is brand new. I modeled this language from the ground up and it is still a WIP.

This is the first attempt I have made at creating an AI that isn't from ideas or concepts. Please leave comments, and also ideas for further versions of this AI, or any others. this is still in beta (version 1.1) This is my first attempt at creating a Ai from scratch and this is also my first time using the method of neural networks. I think it's a huge leap for me in Artificial intellegence.
